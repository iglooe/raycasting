# Raycasting

Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map

## Quick Start

Clone the repo

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/iglooe/raycasting.git
$ cd raycasting
```

Install typescript as a global dependency

```console
$ npm install -g typescript
```

Finally...

```console
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

**If you want to run without installing typescript**

```console
$ ./node_modules/.bin/tsc
```
